# Auto ReadMe

## User Interface: NODE.js
NODE.js is the key to unlocking the power of JavaScript beyond the "front-end". In this project, it allows the user to interact with the terminal in creating a README.md file (in conjuction with js libraries).

## Inquirer: JS Library
Inquirer is how all the user interactions are able to performed, specifically PROMPTING the user and accepting INPUTS. Inputs can be text, boolean "confirms", or multiple-choice. These inputs can drive an application, like this one, so that the user simply has to respond, allowing those responses then to perform all the "work" of formatting the markdown-based README.

## AutoReadMe in Action
AutoReadMe walks through the process of creating a typical ReadMe. When creating a NEW markdown the user is asked for the following:

* Name of the Project

* Author Information (name, email, etc)

* Initial sub-section

* sub-section elements, such as paragraphs, links, images, and bullets

When creating sections, the user is given each of the four options indefinitely until the user selects "create new section" or "complete README".
